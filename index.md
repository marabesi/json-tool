## json-tool

Are you tired of accessing free websites just to format your json content? Me too. Besides the
"data protection" issue sometimes we just want to have it formatted to move on.

json-tool allows you to quick format json content with a click of a button, and much more:

- JSON content validation, it shows an error message warning invalid json
- Buttons to allow easy interaction with the clipboard
- To keep up to date with new releases and more in depth details about the implementation, the code is published on github at https://github.com/marabesi/json-tool
