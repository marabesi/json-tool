# json-tool

Are you tired of accessing **free websites just to format your json content**? Me too. Besides the "data protection" issue sometimes we just want to have it formatted to move on.

**json-tool** allows you to quick format json content with a click of a button, and much more:

- JSON content validation, it shows an error message warning invalid json
- Buttons to allow easy interaction with the clipboard
